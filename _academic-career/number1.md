## Research Focus

My PhD research at [Sharif University of Technology](https://www.sharif.edu/) focuses on advancing 
[deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) techniques for computer vision tasks. 
This work is part of our [AI Research Group](/research-group/) and builds upon my previous 
[master's research](/academic-career/masters-thesis/).

## Key Resources

- **[PyTorch Framework](https://pytorch.org/)** - Primary deep learning framework
- **[TensorFlow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/)** - Reference materials
- **[University Portal](https://edu.sharif.edu/)** - Academic resources
- **[My Publications](/publications/)** - Related papers

## Project Details

This research involves developing novel architectures that you can see in my 
[project portfolio](/portfolio/computer-vision-projects/). For collaboration opportunities,
