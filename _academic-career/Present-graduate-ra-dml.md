## Research Environment & Laboratory Excellence

The Data Science & Machine Learning Laboratory (DML) represents the pinnacle of academic research excellence at Sharif University of Technology, consistently attracting the nation's most exceptional talent. Each year, DML selectively admits top-performing students including national olympiad medalists, top-ranked national university entrance exam recipients, and distinguished graduate candidates across bachelor's, master's, and doctoral programs.

The laboratory has established an extraordinary track record of research output, consistently publishing groundbreaking papers in premier international venues. Our comprehensive publication portfolio, available at [DML Publications](https://dml.ir/publications/papers/), demonstrates sustained excellence across multiple AI research domains.

## Collaborative Culture & Mentorship Structure

DML fosters a uniquely supportive and collegial atmosphere while maintaining rigorous academic standards through a well-defined hierarchical structure. The laboratory operates under a comprehensive mentorship framework where each master's student receives dedicated supervision from senior PhD candidates, complemented by daily progress meetings. This is further enhanced by weekly Sunday sessions with [Professor Rabiee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&hl=en), ensuring continuous guidance and academic development.

## Distinguished Colleagues & Learning Community

I have had the privilege of collaborating with and learning from exceptional peers including:

- [**Armin Behnamnia**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uN1S3JwAAAAJ&hl=en) (National Gold Medalist in Mathematics Olympiad 2013, International Bronze Medalist 2014)
- [**Seyyed Mohammadjavad Feyzabadi Sani**](https://dml.ir/users/profile/299/) (PhD Candidate in Artificial Intelligence)
- [**Morteza Abolghasemi**](https://dml.ir/users/profile/341/) (International Bronze Medalist in Computer Olympiad)
- [**Mahdi Mastani**](https://dml.ir/users/profile/33/) (Top-ranked PhD Entrance Exam Recipient)

These individuals represent just a sample of the approximately 30-40 distinguished researchers who comprise DML's vibrant intellectual community, each bringing unique expertise and perspectives to our collaborative environment.

## Exceptional Leadership & Guidance

I am profoundly grateful for the mentorship of [**Dr. Maryam Ramezani**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cBR8x-4AAAAJ&hl=en) (Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Engineering), whose guidance has opened new horizons in both scientific inquiry and leadership development. 

Similarly, [**Arash Zolghadr**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smf-sani/?originalSubdomain=ir), the laboratory manager, has provided invaluable support and direction that significantly enhanced my research journey.

## Distinguished Professor Hamid R. Rabiee

[**Professor Rabiee**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rKDtrNgAAAAJ&hl=en) brings an extraordinary wealth of international academic and industrial experience to his leadership role. He earned his BS and MS degrees (with Great Distinction) in Electrical Engineering from California State University, Long Beach (1987, 1989), followed by an EEE degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles (1993), and a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Purdue University (1996).

His distinguished career includes positions as Member of Technical Staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories (1993-1996), Senior Software Engineer at Intel Corporation (1996-1999), and adjunct professorships at Portland State University, Oregon Graduate Institute, and Oregon State University (1996-2000). Since 2000, he has been affiliated with Sharif University of Technology, with a visiting professorship at Imperial College London during the 2017-2018 academic year.

Professor Rabiee's entrepreneurial vision has established numerous pioneering initiatives including Sharif University's Advanced Information and Communication Technology Research Institute (AICT), ICT Innovation Center, Advanced Technologies Incubator (SATI), Data Science & Machine Learning Laboratory (DML), and several other research centers. He currently serves as Distinguished Professor of Computer Engineering and Director of the Data Science & AI Innovation Center and DML Laboratories.

His extensive contributions include consulting for the WHO AI in Health Expert Group, membership in IFIP Working Group 10.3 on Concurrent Systems, three patents, and numerous national and international awards. As a Senior IEEE Member, his research spans statistical machine learning, Bayesian statistics, data analytics, and complex networks with applications across social networks, multimedia systems, cloud computing, IoT privacy, bioinformatics, and brain networks.

Every interaction with Professor Rabiee provides profound insights encompassing technical expertise, ethical considerations, and life lessons, making this collaboration one of the most valuable experiences of my professional journey.

## Institutional Recognition

The laboratory's exceptional quality is formally recognized through the university's internal evaluation system, where DML achieved a remarkable score of 270 points—far exceeding the maximum benchmark of 25 points typically awarded to top-tier laboratories, underscoring its unparalleled research environment and output.

## Research Focus

My graduate research concentrates on advancing graph mining methodologies within machine learning, specifically exploring social network analysis and graph networks under Professor Rabiee's supervision. This work leverages DML's exceptional resources and collaborative environment to push the boundaries of current research in complex network analysis and computational social science.
