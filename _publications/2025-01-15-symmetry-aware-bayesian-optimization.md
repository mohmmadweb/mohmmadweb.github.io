## Introduction

Bayesian optimization has emerged as a powerful technique for optimizing expensive black-box functions. However, traditional methods often fail to exploit inherent symmetries in many real-world optimization problems.

## Methodology

We propose a novel max kernel approach that automatically identifies and leverages symmetry properties in the objective function. Our method combines...

## Results

Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate that our symmetry-aware approach achieves up to 40% improvement in sample efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization methods.

## Conclusion

The symmetry-aware Bayesian optimization framework provides a significant advancement in efficient optimization of expensive functions with inherent symmetries.
